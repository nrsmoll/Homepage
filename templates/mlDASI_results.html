        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Methods</h2>
        <p>The models were built on a dataset created by the METs Investigators for the assessement of
            functional capacity before major non-cardiac surgery.<a href="#ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> A range of machine
            learning and traditional biostatistical models were tested. The goal was to find the best fitting model
            with the lowest mean squared error and r<sup>2</sup>.</p>
        <p>The models used to predict the VO<sup>2</sup> Max are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Traditional Linear Regression</li>
            <li>Kernal Ridge Regression</li>
            <li>Random Forest Regression</li>
            <li>Support Vector Regression</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The models underwent hyper-parameter tuning where appropriate, with cross-validation (as re-sampling
            procedure)
            of the training and test datasets. The data was modelled in it's simplest form,
            with the yes/no answers to the DASI reduced to 0 and 1, instead of the suggested scores (which are simply
            weights).
            No transformation needed as the predictors were binary (0 and 1) as per the DASI questionnaire. </p>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Models</h2>
        <p>The final model chosen to predict the VO<sup>2</sup> Max and the AT was random forest regression
            (RFR). It predicted VO<sup>2</sup> Max and AT better than all the other models tested, but resulting in a
            low R<sup>2</sup> of 16.
            This was still far better than the Hlatky equation resulting in a very low R<sup>2</sup> value of -1.8.
            Caution is advised when utilizing
            these results in clinical practice as the model accuracy is low. Nonetheless, the model presented here is
            far better than what has been previously
            used for the prediction of VO<sup>2</sup> Max and AT, without utilizing formal cardiopulmonary exercise
            testing.</p>
